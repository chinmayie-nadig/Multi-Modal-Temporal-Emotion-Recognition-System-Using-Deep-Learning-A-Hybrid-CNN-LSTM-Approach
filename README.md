Overview
This project is an Emotion Recognition System that detects and classifies human emotions using deep learning models. It includes various approaches such as backbone models, temporal models, and validation on the AffectNet dataset. The project is implemented using Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and OpenCV.

Features
->Real-time emotion detection using a webcam
->Testing backbone models for emotion recognition
->Evaluating temporal models on video input
->Face detection and preprocessing
->Experimenting with TensorFlow and PyTorch models
->Validation on the AffectNet dataset
